    h2#what What is Peaches 'n' Stink?
    p
        |Peaches 'n' Stink is a link aggregation Internet forum that has posts and nested comments. 
        |Most other forums show all content and admins blacklist spam. 
        |We show no content, there are no admins and each user must whitelist other users in order to see their content.

    h2#posts Posts
    p
        |Posts are the main way to submit content. 
        |All topics are allowed (unless illegal). 
        |You must be logged in to create a post. 
        |Use  
        a(href="/new") new post
        | 
        |in the site navigation to go to the create post form. 
        |Posts have a title, link, content and a group. 
        |Only title is required. 
        |The 
        a(href="/") home page
        | 
        |displays all posts from all users.

    p
        |There are four ways to sort posts. 
        |These sorting options are available at the top of the 
        a(href="/") home page
        |, 
        |at the top of group pages (e.g. 
        a(href="/r/meta") r/meta
        |), and when using the /posts API call. 
        |Here is a description of each sorting option:
        ul.list1
            li
                b Newest
                |: This is a reverse chronological ordering based on the post time, 
                |and this is also the default.
            li
                b Oldest
                |: This is a chronological ordering based on the post time.
            li
                b Comments
                |: This ordering is based on the number of comments a post has. 
                |The posts with the most comments will appear first.
            li
                b Last Comment
                |: This ordering is based on the last comment time for the post. 
                |The post with the most recent comment will appear first.

    h2#comments Comments
    p
        |You can write comments on posts and other comments. 
        |You must be logged in to create a comment. 
        |If you're logged in, then there's a comment form at the top of each post and comment page, and 
        |there are "reply" links below each comment.

    h2#inbox Inbox
    p
        |The 
        a(href="/inbox") inbox
        | 
        | shows all comments that have been made directly on your posts and comments.

    h2#formatting Formatting
    p
        |These are the available formatting rules for posts and comments:
        ul.list1
            li
                |All newlines are automatically preserved.
            li
                |You can use 
                i ```pre
                | 
                |and 
                i ```
                | 
                |to preserve spaces/whitespace for a group of lines. 
                i ```pre
                | 
                |must come first on its own line and 
                i ```
                | 
                |must come last on its own line. 
                |All whitespace in between will be preserved. 
                |This is intended for writing computer programming source code.
            li
                |You can create hyperlinks by putting brackets before the URL. 
                |For example like this: 
                i []https://www.mysite.com
                |. If you want to use custom text put it in the brackets, e.g.: 
                i [green]http://colors.com/green
                |.

    h2#groups Groups
    p
        |When you create a post you can add it to a group (this is optional). 
        |Each group has its own page with all of its posts. 
        |For example, the 
        a(href="/r/meta") meta group
        |. Groups display to the right of the post time for each post; 
        |click these links to go to the group's page!

    h2#following Following
    p
        |On the right side of usernames there is a plus or minus button. 
        |You can follow the respective user with the plus button. 
        |The minus button unfollows. 
        |You can only see posts and comments that have been posted by users that you're following. 
        |You can manage who you're following by using 
        a(href="/following") following
        | 
        |in the site navigation (if you're logged in).

    h2#settings Settings
    p
        |You can access the 
        a(href="/settings") settings
        | 
        |in the site navigation. 
        |You can use the settings even if you're logged out. 
        |If you are logged in, then there is an additional settings page for 
        a(href="/settings/username") username
        |. 
        |The available settings are:
        ul.list1
            li
                b Time Zone
                |: this will adjust the time that is displayed for each post and comment.
            li
                b Following List
                |: this determines which list of users you will use. 
                |You can use your own list (the users you follow) or another user's list. 
                |You can only see posts and comments made by users on the selected list.
            li
                b Site Width
                |: you can use this setting to set the site width. 
                |Valid values are 500-1000 or blank. 
                |If you use a number between 500-1000 then that will be the site width in pixels 
                |and the site will be horizontally centered. 
                |If this setting is left blank then the site will take up the entire browser width. 
                |The default value is 600.
            li
                b View Mode
                |: this affects how posts and comments display that are from unfollowed users; 
                |"locked" completely hides these posts and comments, while "discover" will show these posts and 
                |comments but only with the username and time. There is a shortcut to toggle this option at the top of
                |every list of posts and comments.
            li
                b Replying to Comments
                |: this affects how the comment reply links work. If you select "basic" then 
                |comment reply links will take you to a comment form on a different page. If you select 
                |"quick" then comment reply links will immediately open a comment form under the reply link. 
                |The default is "quick". This is only for logged in users.
            li
                b Username
                |: You can use this setting to change your username. 
                |This is only for logged in users. 
                |This setting has 
                a(href="/settings/username") its own page
                |.

    h2#editing Editing
    p
        |You can edit your posts and comments anytime you want. 
        |For posts, the edit link is to the right of the comment count. 
        |And for comments the edit link is to the right of the permalink and reply links. 
        |Currently there is no delete post or delete comment - but you can delete content via editing.
