    h2#what What is #{siteName}?
    p
        |#{siteName} is an internet forum.
        |Users can write posts and nested comments.

    h2#posts Posts
    p
        |Posts are the main way to submit content. 
        |All topics are allowed (unless illegal). 
        |You must be logged in to create a post. 
        |Use  
        a(href="/new") new post
        | 
        |in the site navigation to go to the create post form. 
        |Posts have a title, link, content and a group. 
        |Only title is required. 
        |The 
        a(href="/") home page
        | 
        |displays all posts from all users.

    p
        |There are four ways to sort posts. 
        |These sorting options are available at the top of the 
        a(href="/") home page
        |, 
        |at the top of group pages (e.g. 
        a(href="/r/meta") r/meta
        |), and when using the /posts API call. 
        |Here is a description of each sorting option:
        ul.list1
            li
                b Newest
                |: This is a reverse chronological ordering based on the post time, 
                |and this is also the default.
            li
                b Oldest
                |: This is a chronological ordering based on the post time.
            li
                b Comments
                |: This ordering is based on the number of comments a post has. 
                |The posts with the most comments will appear first.
            li
                b Last Comment
                |: This ordering is based on the last comment time for the post. 
                |The post with the most recent comment will appear first.

    h2#comments Comments
    p
        |You can write comments on posts and other comments. 
        |You must be logged in to create a comment. 
        |If you're logged in, then there's a comment form at the top of each post and comment page, and 
        |there are "reply" links below each comment.

    h2#user-profiles User Profiles
    p.
        All usernames link to the user's profile page. 
        User profile pages display the username, profile blurb (if the user has filled it in), and a follow/unfollow button. 
        Users can edit their profile on the #[a(href="/settings/profile") profile settings] page.

    h2#inbox Inbox
    p
        |The 
        a(href="/inbox") inbox
        | 
        | shows all comments that have been made directly on your posts and comments.

    h2#formatting Formatting
    p
        |These are the available formatting rules for posts, comments and user profiles:
        ul.list1
            li
                |All newlines are automatically preserved.
            li
                |You can use 
                i ```pre
                | 
                |and 
                i ```
                | 
                |to preserve spaces/whitespace for a group of lines. 
                i ```pre
                | 
                |must come first on its own line and 
                i ```
                | 
                |must come last on its own line. 
                |All whitespace in between will be preserved. 
                |This is intended for writing computer programming source code.
            li
                |You can create hyperlinks by putting brackets before the URL. 
                |For example like this: 
                i []https://www.mysite.com
                |. If you want to use custom text put it in the brackets, e.g.: 
                i [green]http://colors.com/green
                |.

    h2#groups Groups
    p
        |When you create a post you can add it to a group (this is optional). 
        |Each group has its own page with all of its posts. 
        |For example, the 
        a(href="/r/meta") meta group
        |. Groups display to the right of the post time for each post; 
        |click these links to go to the group's page!

    h2#private-groups Private Groups
    p
        |By default, all posts and comments are public. 
        |But with private groups, you can use #{siteName} privately 
        |with your friends, family and peers. Private groups use the same 
        |mechanism as "normal" groups and can be mixed with them.

    p
        |In order to create a private group you must log in and go to 
        a(href="/settings/groups") groups settings
        |. On this page you can create new private groups, see all your created private groups, 
        |and see all the other private groups you're a part of. 
        |For each of your created private groups, there is a settings link 
        |where you can add and remove users.

    p
        |All private groups must start with "p-", for example, "p-cheese". When you 
        |first create a private group it must be empty of posts. 
        |Private groups attached to posts cannot be edited like normal groups. 
        |It is possible to use multiple private groups on the same post. 
        |Posts and comments from private groups will properly show and hide throughout 
        |the entire site. For example, posts from your private groups will appear on the home page. 
        |Posts and comments for private groups are currently stored in the database the same way 
        |as normal groups - in other words, private groups content is not currently encrypted or 
        |anything like that.

    h2#following Following
    p
        |On the right side of usernames there is a plus or minus button. 
        |You can follow the respective user with the plus button. 
        |The minus button unfollows. 
        |You can only see posts and comments that have been posted by users that you're following. 
        |You can manage who you're following by using 
        a(href="/following") following
        | 
        |in the site navigation (if you're logged in).

    h2#settings Settings
    p.
        You can access the #[a(href="/settings") general settings] in the main site navigation.
        You can use the general settings even if you're logged out.
        Additional settings for logged in users are at #[a(href="/settings/username") username], #[a(href="/settings/profile") profile], #[a(href="/settings/groups") groups] and #[a(href="/settings/app-ids") app IDs].
        Username is for changing your username, and profile is for editing your profile blurb.
        The instructions for groups can be found in the #[a(href="/help#private-groups") private groups] section.
        App IDs are for developers and the instructions can be found in step 1 of the #[a(href="/api#api-user-authentication") user authentication] section of the #[a(href="/api") API documentation].

    p
        |The following are the #[a(href="/settings") general settings]:
        ul.list1
            li
                b Time Zone
                |: this will adjust the time that is displayed for each post and comment.
            li
                b Site Width
                |: you can use this setting to set the site width. 
                |Valid values are #{min_site_width}-#{max_site_width} or blank. 
                |If you use a number between #{min_site_width}-#{max_site_width} then that will be the site width in pixels 
                |and the site will be horizontally centered. 
                |If this setting is left blank then the site will take up the entire browser width. 
                |The default value is #{default_site_width}.
            li
                b Posts Per Page
                |: this is how many posts to list on the home page and group pages. 
                |It must be between #{min_ppp} and #{max_ppp}. The default is #{default_ppp}.
            li
                b Post Spacing
                |: when there are lists of posts this is the vertical amount of space 
                |in pixels between each post. It must be between 
                |#{min_pvs} and #{max_pvs}. The default is #{default_pvs}.
            li
                b View Mode
                |: this affects how posts and comments display that are from unfollowed users; 
                |"locked" completely hides these posts and comments, while "discover" will show these posts and 
                |comments but only with the username and time. There is a shortcut to toggle this option at the top of
                |every list of posts and comments.
            li
                b Post Layout
                |: this setting determines the layout for posts on the home page and group pages. 
                |You can choose the standard two line layout, 
                |or there is a single line layout option that is good for dense posts.
            li
                b Replying to Comments
                |: this affects how the comment reply links work. If you select "basic" then 
                |comment reply links will take you to a comment form on a different page. If you select 
                |"quick" then comment reply links will immediately open a comment form under the reply link. 
                |The default is "quick". This is only for logged in users.
            li
                b Main Background Color
                |: this is the background color for the main area that contains all the content.
            li
                b Secondary Background Color
                |: this is the background color for the secondary background that doesn't contain any content.
            li
                b Main Text Color
                |: text color of most text that isn't a hyperlink
